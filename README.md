## Debugging

Install React webchrome module at : 
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi

Launch developement tools in Chrome and go to "React" tab.
In the React tab you can access to the whole React app & states in the main window.

To stop at a certain point you can add "debugger;" anywhere in your code while de developer tool is open to stop your code at this point.
In combination with "source-map" (add this line in your webpack.config : "devtool: 'inline-source-map'") and developer console, debugging become a peace of cake.
